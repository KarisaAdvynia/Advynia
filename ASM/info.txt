I couldn't find a way to embed an assembler in Advynia as planned, so I needed 
to apply the patches as hex code. For the sake of ensuring the patch source 
is modifiable, I've included each patch in this folder with Advynia's source.

Each patch was applied to a test ROM using Armips 
(https://github.com/Kingcom/armips), then the resulting offsets and hex data 
were manually copied into Adv3Patch, for use when Advynia appllies the patches.

Be warned that several patches use the vanilla sublevel region as freespace, 
which is noted within the patch. Advynia auto-relocates those sublevels if 
needed, but if you're applying them manually, make sure you aren't overwriting 
anything important!
